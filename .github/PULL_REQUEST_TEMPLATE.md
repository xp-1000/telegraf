### Before Filing a Pull Request
Pull requests unrelated to the SignalFx authored plugins should be submitted directly to the [upstream](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) Telegraf project.  Please make those changes on a branch cut from the upstream project as the code for our plugins have not be contributed back to the upstream project.

If the proposed changes are to any of the SignalFx plugins, please provide a description of your changes.
